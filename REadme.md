# Elevator Simulation

This is a simple Python script that simulates an elevator moving between floors. The user can input a target floor, and the elevator will move step by step to reach the desired floor.

## Features
- Moves between floors 1 to 10.
- Displays each step as the elevator moves up or down.
- Prevents invalid floor selections.
- Allows the user to exit the program by entering `0`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x (Recommended: 3.6+)

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Save the script as `elevator.py`.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the script location.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python elevator.py
   ```
5. Follow the prompts to select floors.

## Example Usage
```
Enter the floor number (1-10, or 0 to exit): 5
Going up... Floor 2
Going up... Floor 3
Going up... Floor 4
Going up... Floor 5
Arrived at floor 5!
```
